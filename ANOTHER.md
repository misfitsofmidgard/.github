## THE TWELVE LAWS OF C# CLEAN ARCHITECTURE

INSPIRED BY JOCKO WILLINK'S TWELVE LAWS OF COMBAT

### 1. Independence

Modules should be independent of each other. This minimizes dependencies and allows for easier maintenance and refactoring.

### 2. Abstraction

Define clear abstractions between different parts of the system. Interfaces and abstract classes are crucial in C# for achieving this.

### 3. Separation of Concerns

Separate concerns like data access, business logic, and user interface into distinct layers or modules.

### 4. Testability

Design the architecture to be easily testable. Utilize dependency injection and interfaces to facilitate unit testing in C#.

### 5. Maintainability

Prioritize code maintainability through clear naming conventions, proper documentation, and modular design.

### 6. Flexibility

Design the system to be adaptable to future changes and requirements. Use design patterns like the Strategy pattern or the Template Method pattern to achieve flexibility.

### 7. Reusability

Identify and extract reusable components and libraries. C# offers strong support for creating and consuming reusable libraries.

### 8. Performance

Optimize for performance where necessary, but prioritize maintainability and readability first.

### 9. Simplicity

Strive for simplicity in design and implementation. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

### 10. Consistency

Maintain consistency in coding style, naming conventions, and architectural patterns throughout the project.

### 11. Domain-Driven Design

Align the architecture with the domain model, using C# features like enums and value objects to represent domain concepts accurately.

### 12. Continuous Improvement

Regularly review and refactor the architecture to improve its quality, maintainability, and performance.
