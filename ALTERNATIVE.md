## THE TWELVE LAWS OF C# CLEAN ARCHITECTURE (Jocko Style)

These laws aren't suggestions. They're the standards. Violate them, and your codebase will become a chaotic, unmaintainable mess. We're talking technical debt that'll crush you. Good.

1. Discipline of Dependency Inversion: You will decouple high-level modules from low-level modules through abstractions. Interfaces are your weapon. Implementations are details. Control the dependencies, or they will control you. This is non-negotiable.

2. Follow SOLID Principles: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion. These are not buzzwords. They are the foundation of maintainable code. Master them. Live them. Breathe them. Or get out.

3. Extreme Ownership of Use Cases: Each use case is a distinct operation. Define clear input and output. Isolate the logic. Own the entire flow. No excuses. If it breaks, it's on you.

4. Decisive Action on Boundaries: Define clear boundaries between layers: Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure. Use interfaces and abstract classes to enforce these boundaries. No bleeding of concerns. Keep them separate. Keep them clean.

5. Simplicity of Entities: Entities are the core business objects. Keep them lean. Focus on core data and behavior. No unnecessary complexity. Complexity is the enemy. Simplicity is the way.

6. Prioritize Testability: Write unit tests for every use case, every entity, every service. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is not optional. It's the standard. If it's not tested, it's broken. Period.

7. Detachment from Frameworks: Your core business logic should not depend on any specific framework. Frameworks are tools. They can change. Your business logic is constant. Decouple it.

8. Constant Communication via Interfaces: Use interfaces to define contracts between modules. This allows for flexibility and maintainability. Clear communication prevents misunderstandings. In code and in life.

9. Cover and Move with Unit Tests: Unit tests provide cover, allowing you to refactor and improve your code with confidence. No refactoring without tests. That's a recipe for disaster.

10. Decentralized Decision Making with Modules: Divide your application into cohesive modules. Each module has its own responsibility. This allows for parallel development and reduces complexity. Decentralize the decisions. Empower the modules.

11. Leading from the Front with Clean Code: Write clean, readable code. Follow coding standards. Use meaningful names. Comment when necessary, but strive for self-documenting code. Lead by example. Set the standard.

12. No Excuses. Execute the Architecture: This is not a theoretical exercise. This is real-world software development. Implement these laws. Enforce them. No excuses. Execute.
